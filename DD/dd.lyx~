Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this document is to describe all the requirements and the
 specifications for the PowerEnjoy System.
 It specifies goals of the software to be and all the functionalities expected.
 We will also list all the non-functional requirements and assumptions we've
 made.
 We have included possible scenarios, use-cases and UML diagrams to help
 clarify the scope of the system and gain a deeper undestanding of the software
 to be.
 This document is intended to be used by the members of the project team
 that will implement and verify the correct functioning of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PowerEnjoy is a digital management system for a car-sharing service that
 exclusively employs electric cars.
 It allows registered clients (Power Users) to use a vehicle paying only
 on the basis of the actual use during each individual rental.
 In addition to the classic functionalities expected on a car sharing service,
 it will also incentivize environment-friendly and virtuous behaviours of
 the Power Users, providing discounts on the regular ride fee.
 PowerEnjoy employs a single model of electric car which comes with pre-installe
d sensors that can be used to monitor the car status (battery level, location,
 etc..) at any given time.
 The car can be picked up from a safe areas or from a Power Enjoy Charging
 Stations, and should be left in another safe area.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Power User will be charged only for the time he has rented the car,
 there are no subscritions or additional prices to use the service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our system interacts with two external services: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Payment Service 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An Assistance Service 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The role of this two systems and the interaction will be cover in the next
 chapter.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Text Assumption and Policies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Text Assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The text doesn't specify what should happen if a user parks in a unsafe
 area.
 Since it's really restrictive to prevent this situation from happening
 we've decided the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As soon as a Power Uses turns the engine off, it will be notified through
 the car display if he has parked in an unsafe area.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If he decide nevertheless to exit the vehicle, the rent will not stop and
 the user will continue to be charged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the car is left in the same unsafe area for more than 1 hour, the rent
 will eventually end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The car will become unavailable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The AS will be notified to take the car back to a safe area.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
User will be charged for the extra time to cover the costs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fines may still apply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The text doesn't specify how payments should be handled, we supposed there
 is an external payment service (e.g.
 Paypal) that takes care of processing payments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discount Policy 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As said earlier Power Enjoy not only allows to use a vehicle paying only
 on the basis of the actual use during each individual rental but also incentivi
zes virtuos behaviour providing discounts to the regular ride fee.
 The discounts offered are the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If a Power User takes at least two other passengers onto the car, the system
 applies a discount of 10% for the shared ride.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If a car is left with more than 50% of the battery, the system applies a
 discount of 20% on the last ride.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If a car is left at Power Enjoy Charging Station where they can be recharged
 and the user takes care of plugging the car into the power grid, the system
 applies a discount of 30% on the last ride.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Discounts are only applied if a car is parked in a safe area.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To qualify for a Shared Ride discount a Power User must take 2 passengers
 for at least the 90% of the Ride lenght.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Discounts are comulative except for discounts 2.
 and 3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This means that if a user recharges a car with more than 50% of residual
 battery, the final discount applied is 30%.
 This is to avoid early recharges and guarantee a better distribution of
 the cars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fines Policy 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To provide a fair and equal car sharing among all customers, Power Enjoy
 penalizes unfair usage of the service: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If a car is left at more than 3 KM from the nearest Power Enjoy Charging
 Station or with less than 20%, the system charges 30% more on the last
 ride to compensate for the cost required to re- charge the car on-site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a ride qualifies for both a discount and a fine, only the fine will be
 applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Legal Policy 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system must require his users the permission to get his position and
 to manage sensible data respecting the privacy law.
 To provide financial protection against physical damage and/or bodily injury
 resulting from traffic collisions and against any liability every Power
 Enjoy Vehicle has stipulate a full insurance.
 To avoid legal problems when registering the user acknowledges that to
 be covered by the insurance the driver must always be the same person whose
 account has been used to reserve the car.
 In case this is not true and for all the cases not covered by our insurance
 the Power User will take full responsibility of any third party actions.
 In other words, Power Enjoy doesn't prevent a Power User from delegating
 some else as the driver but only the Power User would be held responsible
 for any possible damage caused.
 In any case, the following conditions always hold: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Any driver must be in possession of a valid driving license 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The vehicle is to be driven in full compliance with the Highway Code, the
 Civil Code, the Penal Code and in general with maximum diligence 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Any financial penalties for violation of the legal rules relating to the
 movement of vehicles will be notified to the Power User who undertakes
 to pay the fines 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vehicles must not be stolen or parked in private areas
\end_layout
