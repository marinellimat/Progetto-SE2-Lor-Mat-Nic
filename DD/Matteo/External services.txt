External Services

Are considered External Services all systems that interact with the applicaton server, not developed in this project.
The car board computer, the Assistance Service and the Payment System.
Car Board computer must work as a connection between the car and the application server and between the car and users. The functionalities Of the board computer must be at least:
1) Showing message directed to the user from the application server (ongoing fee).
2) Must calculate the shared ride time.
3) Sending information via messages about the car (battery level, status, position, passengers, shared ride,...) to the application server.
Assistance Service is the Server/Application/Program used by an assistance office to interact with the application server. The interaction between Application Server and Assistance Service will be bidirectional: the application server must send the information about a malfunctioning car togheter with the problem and the Assistance system must notify the application server the mafunctioning car is redy for power enjoy service again.
Payment System is the system the server access to lets happen a payment. Paypal could be an example. Systems of this kind alredy exists so the application server will rely to them, the interaction is standard: Application Server send the fee and the Payment System, after executing the transaction, respond with the outcome, positive or negative.

About the languages of implementation, nothing can be suggested for the Payment Systems because they aredy exists, about board computer and Assistance Service the choice of the language is free, the only suggestion is to consider the language of the application server to guarantee an efficent communication. Conveniently, the communication wwith Application server will be implemente via RESTful APIs defined by the partners (external services).
