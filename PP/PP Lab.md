#Lab Project Plan 


##2. Function Points ESTIMATION
Understand the complexity 
Looking at the functionality: (5 Classes) 

1. int logic file (those of the system to implement)

2. ext logic file (external system to integrate/coordinate)
	- Data archives (stores the data to achieve functionality)
	- Classify the complexity based in #record in the data file (low, avg, high)
	- Subjective choice (more important the explanation below than the actual number, based on the context, expected load) e.g. 1kk user is fine in New York

3. external input
4. external inquiry
5. external output

	- weights are given

COMMON ERROR:
	- complexity is low/avg/high... WHY?

REALISTIC FUNCTION EXTIMATION

##3.COCOMO
Don't care about the numbers but it's important the reasoning

##4. Scheduling/Allocation resources over time 
- Pretend you're at the beginning, come up with a credibile project plan. Come up with the activity design. 
- Meet stakeholder
- Chart like in the slide, people & task over time

##5. Risk Management (REALISTIC CREDIBLE RISKs)
- Driver license changement
- table ( RISK | MITIGATION STRATEGY )
- Competitors are risks
- Software to diffucult to use for average customer
